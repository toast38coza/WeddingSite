There are flights from both Cape Town and Johannesburg. Once in Walvis, it is approximately 30 kms to the town of Swakopmund\r\nSAA and Air Namibia either fly directly to Walvis Bay or via Windhoek\r\nIf you fly to Windhoek: it is approximately a five hour drive to Swakopmund\r\n\r\nDriving:\r\nFrom Cape Town: It is a direct route north on the N7/B2 to Windhoek for 1470km, then an additional 365km East on B2 towards Swakopmund. This is approximately a 20 hour drive.\r\nFrom Gauteng: You are able to drive through the scenic trans-Kalagadi highway via Botswana into Namibia. This is approximately 1785 kms (also around 20 hours of driving)\r\nIf driving we'd recommend breaking the journey by staying over at a recommended B&B along the way (see 'Where to stay')\r\nIf driving a vehicle from South Africa, make sure that you have a \u2018ZA\u2019 sticker visible on the back of your car. These can be purchased from any AA or travel store.  Failure to have a ZA sticker may result in a fine. \r\nYou will also need to pay an entry fee upon arrival in Namibia.  Please keep the documentation and receipt of payment in your car at all times.  These documents are subject to inspection at road blocks and border posts.\r\nIf you are subject to a fine in Namibia you are obliged to settle the amount in the region you incurred the fine.  For example, if you are on your way to Swakopmund and are fined in Rehoboth, you will have to settle your fine at the municipality in Rehoboth... So try avoid getting fines in Namibia!\r\n", "title": "How do we get there?", "slug": "some-question", "wedding": 1}, "model": "faq.faq", "pk": 5}, {"fields": {"description": "Car hire: Car hire is fairly simple and easy. Most of the South African car hire companies operate in Namibia, such as Hertz, Budget car rental and Avis.  You are able to pick up the vehicle from the Walvis Bay airport, Windhoek airport or Swakopmund. \r\nWalking: if you stay in or near the centre of town, most attractions and restaurants are within walking distance.  It is generally safe to walk, but please be vigilant at all times and walk in groups. \r\nTaxis: Taxis are not common in Swakopmund but are available in and around town.", "title": "Getting around in Swakopmund", "slug": "getting-around-in-swakopmund", "wedding": 1}, "model": "faq.faq", "pk": 8}, {"fields": {"description": "Yes, you will need a passport!\r\nSouth African citizens do not require a VISA for Namibia.

The Rand is legal tender in Namibia. But the N$ can not be used in South Africa. Most of the major South African banks operate in Namibia.  \r\nCredit cards are accepted at most supermarkets, restaurants and accommodation establishments in Swakopmund (Visa and Mastercard are most commonly accepted) but outlets in rural areas are more likely to only accept cash payment.\r\nCredit cards can NOT be used to buy petrol.", "title": "Passport, Visa, Currency and Language...", "slug": "passport-visa-currency-and-language", "wedding": 1}, "model": "faq.faq", "pk": 9}]
